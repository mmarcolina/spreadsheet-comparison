# spreadsheet-comparison
Uses the power of several python modules to compare data in two spreadsheets and point out differences between columns. 

## Dependencies
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. openpyxl

### How this project can be improved:
* Implement a function that allows for the comparison of data of the same ID/name but are located in different rows.
* Auto-highlighting function that highlights cells in the output document that contains the '{} --> {}' indicator, expressing differences between values.
* Write tests that verify functionality of newly implemented features.
